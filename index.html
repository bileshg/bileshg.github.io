			<section>
				<p>
					Hi, I am <strong>Bilesh Ganguly</strong>, a <strong>Technology Lead</strong> with over <strong>9
						years of experience</strong> in the IT
					industry, currently specializing in the <strong>Data Integration</strong> domain. Throughout my
					career, I have worked
					on a wide
					variety of projects and have gained proficiency in various tools such as SnapLogic, Salesforce, and
					Reltio.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started my career as a Java developer, which helped me develop a solid understanding of the
					software development
					lifecycle. Over the years, I have honed my programming and debugging skills in Python, Java, and
					JavaScript.
				</p>
				<p>
					I hold a <strong>Master's degree in Computer Science</strong> from <strong>St. Xavier's College,
						Kolkata</strong>,
					which has given me a strong foundation in software development principles.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am passionate about technology and delivering high-quality solutions while staying up-to-date with
					the latest
					trends. I am always eager to collaborate with others and take on new challenges to help drive
					business success.

						<span class="date">March 2016 - Present</span>

				<p><i>Design, develop and refine data integration solutions</i></p>
				<p>
					My current responsibilities involve:
				<ul>
					<li>Operational accountability for the existing technology footprint, consisting of various cloud
						applications,
						scripts, integrations, and reports</li>
					<li>Function as a senior member of an agile team and help drive consistent development practices
					</li>
					<li>Work with product owners and business users to determine and document project requirements</li>
					<li>Partner with the Project Manager, QA Lead, and Ops team to design solutions and release code
					</li>
					<li>Liaising with team members, management, and clients to ensure projects are completed as per
						standard</li>
					<li>Provide support and escalation for investigations and incident management</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Previously, I have worked on building data integration solutions for the Reltio Cloud MDM Platform
					using SnapLogic iPaaS and creating tools for providing an additional layer of functionality to the
					Reltio
					Cloud MDM. Following are some of the highlights:
				<ul>
					<li>Created loading pipelines for loading data into Reltio Cloud MDM from various source systems
						like MySQL,
						Oracle, and PostgreSQL</li>
					<li>Created extraction pipelines to extract data from Reltio to PostgreSQL</li>
					<li>Wrote and optimized SQL queries for fetching the data to be loaded</li>
					<li>Created an automatic configuration generation tool which is a command-line tool that, when
						provided with
						a data model, can generate a Reltio configuration against it</li>
					<li>Created an automated configuration testing framework to check if a Reltio configuration was
						created as
						per the provided business requirements</li>
					<li>Created Reltio configurations based on business requirements</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, I have developed pipelines (in SnapLogic) that act
					as API leveraging ULTRA Tasks to serve relevant data from MDM to be consumed by various downstream
					systems
					and applications. Worked on a Python-based match engine that when configured for a certain
					implemented MDM
					system can intelligently merge a large number of potential matches by itself without any manual
					intervention.

					<h2>RedoQ</h2>
					<p><i>Java Developer</i><br />
						<span class="date">February 2015 - February 2016</span>
					</p>
				</header>
				<p><i>Designed and developed platform-independent desktop applications using JavaFX.</i></p>
				<p>
					My job responsibilities involved understanding client requirements and breaking down program
					specification into simpler elements and then translating that logic into code, designing (and
					creating) the schemas based on business requirements and then utilizing them in the application,
					installing the application(s) and conducting final testing.

					The applications that I worked on include:
				<ul>
					<li>An ERP system that provides an integrated view of core business processes.</li>
					<li>A POS (Point Of Sale) system which is integrated with both online and offline ordering systems.
					</li>
					<li>An HRM system for managing payroll of daily wage workers.</li>
				</ul>

					<h2>Data Foundation</h2>
					<p><span class="date">April 2016 - Present</span>
					</p>
				</header>
				<p>As organizations and companies expand, they often adopt disparate software solutions and systems to
					meet their evolving
					needs. Over time, these numerous systems, which may not be inherently designed to work together, can
					end up with
					conflicting and sometimes outdated information. The primary goal in this scenario is to develop a
					Master Data
					Management (MDM) solution that serves as a centralized repository or the single source of truth.
					This centralized
					system will enable various applications and downstream systems to access accurate and up-to-date
					data.
				</p>
				<p>To achieve this, our approach involved several key steps. Initially, we develop data schemas building
					upon our
					out-of-the-box industry-specific configurations that align with the specific business requirements,
					ensuring that the
					data structure fulfills the requirements. Following this, we configure the chosen master data
					management platform to
					align with these predefined schemas. Once the configuration is in place, we migrate data from legacy
					systems into the
					MDM and build integrations from upstream (source) systems to the MDM. Once the MDM is populated we
					analyze the data and
					implement matching and merging strategies into the MDM platform.
				</p>
				<p>In addition to setting up the MDM, we focus on the crucial aspect of data integration and automation.
					We design and
					develop robust solutions for ingesting data into the MDM platform and extracting data from it. These
					data integration
					solutions ensure seamless flow and synchronization of data between the MDM system and other
					applications or systems
					within the organization, thereby supporting the overall data consistency and reliability across the
					enterprise.
